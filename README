Part 1:

Consider the set of natural numbers (i.e. 1,2,3,...) a,b,c for which

a^2+b^2=c^2

Find a set of numbers a,b,c which also satisfy the property:

a+b+c=4070

Part 2:

Consider the cipher in which the number x is encrypted to

E(x) = (w * x + v ) % 256

This only works if w is relatively prime to 256, i.e. the only number which divides both w and 256 is 1.

Let  {a, b, c} be the answer from part 1. One of {a % 256, b % 256} is equal to w. v is equal to (c % 256).

The ascii value of each byte of the file encrypted.txt is encrypted in this manner. Decrypt it and follow the instructions contained inside.
